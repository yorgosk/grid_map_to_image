# Grid map to image conversion and feature matching

A ROS node that converts a grid map to an image using OpenCV. A collection
of scripts is also included, one that creates a .png using traversability
layers' data from text files and one that applies a variety of feature matching
methods between two .png images.

The grid map and the traversability estimation data is produced by two ETHZ's
projects which can be found at: https://github.com/ethz-asl/grid_map and
https://github.com/ethz-asl/traversability_estimation.

## WARNING

This project is still under development.
